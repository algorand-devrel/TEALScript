# 1. Intro and Prerequisites

This tutorial will who you how to build a DAO contract on Algorand with TEALScript. This content is targeted at beginners and covers a wide range of core Algorand concepts, but doesn't go too indepth on any one subject. It also assumes some basic prior knowledge with TypeScript.

This tutorial is based on the contract developed during the beginner and intermediate bootcamps, which also covers front-end and test development (not covered here). To view the bootcamp content, inlcuding pre-recorded videos going over the code, go to [github.com/algorand-bootcamp](https://github.com/algorand-bootcamp). 

## Prerequisites 

Before beginning, make sure you have Algokit installed. Go [here](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/algokit/) for a quick start guide.
